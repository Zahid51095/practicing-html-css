        <h3>History of Tajhat Place</h3>
        <p>Tajhat Palace, Tajhat Rajbari, is a historic palace of Bangladesh, located in Tajhat, Rangpur.This palace now holds the Rangpur museum. Tajhat Palace is situated six km. south-east of the city of Rangpur, on the outskirts of town.The palace was built by Maharaja Kumar Gopal Lal Roy in the beginning of the 20th century. It is believed that from the conspicuous appearance of his Taj or jeweled crown, his estate derived the name of Tajhat.

            From 1984 to 1991 the palace was used as a Rangpur High Court Branch of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. In 1995 the palace was declared as a protected monument by the Department of Archaeology. Recognizing its outstanding architectural value the Government of Bangladesh shifted the Rangpur Museum to the second floor of the palace in 2005. The main room at the top of the marble stairs have a number of display cases which show 10thâ€“11th century terracotta artifacts. There are a number of fine examples of Sanskrit and Arabic manuscripts, including copies of the Mahabharat, Ramayan, and a Quran whose provenance is attributed to none other than the Mughal Aurangzeb. The back rooms have several examples of black stone Hindu carvings in its back rooms, mainly of the deity Vishnu. Photography is not permitted in the museum itself.</p>
